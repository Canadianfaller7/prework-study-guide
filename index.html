        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE: This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.<br> 
            This particular !DOCTYPE html declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>ul is an unordered list and will give bulletpoints to your list items which you will make using the li element</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. 
            They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each 
            inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, 
            and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, 
            a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.

            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a <strong>link</strong> element placed in the HTML's <strong>head</strong>, 
            as shown in the following code: <strong>link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"</strong></li>
        </ul>

          <li>git -A: We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m: We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.<br>
